  Tartuffe was written by French playwright, Molière.  This drama was first performed in 1664 in Versailles for the King of France.  The performance and text evolved after the 1664 debut, due in part to pressure from the church.  The titular characer of Tartuffe is an over-the-top religious zealot, and the antagonist of the drama.  The church was concerned that the play was overly critical of Christianity.  The final rendition of Tartuffe was completed in 1669 and was edited to appease the uneasements of the Catholic church.

  Tartuffe is a personal favorite comedic drama of mine.  It explores the nature of tricksters and fakers, and how they should be dealt with by rational people.

<h2>Characters</h2>
<div class='character'>
  <span>Tartuffe</span>
  <p>
    The center of this drama, predictably, is around a man named Tartuffe.  Tartuffe is a hypocrite.  He claims to be a godly man, but it is revealed quickly that he is comically self-centered.  His piety and devotions to God are a hollow ruse to endear other people to him.  During this drama, he resides with Orgon and his family, as a guest in their house.

<div class='character'>
  <span>Orgon</span>
  <p>
    Orgon is a wealthy father and husband, and is the figurehead of his family.  He has taken a liking to Tartuffe, and invited him into his home to live.  Orgon is obsessed with the well-being of Tartuffe, even more than he is with that of his family.  Orgon has faith in Tartuffe's godliness and piety, and sees him as a righteous man and role-model.

</div>
<div class='character'>
  <span>Elmire</span>
  <p>
    Elmire is Orgon's wife.  She is level-headed and rational, at least compared to the rest of her family.  She sees Tartuffe for the fake he is, but Elmire is subtle in her approaches to correct the situation.  
  </p>
</div>
<div class='character'>
  <span>Damis</span>
  <p>
    Damis is Orgon and Elmire's son.  He is not fooled by Tartuffe's false piety, but he acts rashly.  He is a caricature of masculinity to an extent; he openly gripes about Tartuffe and seeks justice and vengeance for his family. 
  </p>
</div>
<div class='character'>
  <span>Mariane</span>
  <p>
    Mariane is Orgon and Elmire's daughter.  She is planning to marry Damis's friend, a boy named Valere.  Mariane, contrasted to her brother, is a parody of femininity.  She is complacent, and bows to the will of her father at times, even when it makes no sense.
  </p>
</div>
<div class='character'>
  <span>Cléante</span>
  <p>
    Cléante is Orgon's brother.  He is not part of the nuclear family.  This gives him the perspective of being an outsider to the whole situation.  As such, he acts in part as a narrator and a voice of reason in the play.
  </p>
</div>
<div class='character'>
  <span>Dorine</span>
  <p>
    Dorine is the family maid.  She is a counterpart to Cléante in that she is also a voice of wisdom.  However, she is more directly involved in family affairs and she speaks arcanely compared to Cléante.  While Orgon's brother is straightforward and level, Dorine is sassy and impudent.  Despite her comedic insubordination, she is still one of the primary voices of reason in the drama.
