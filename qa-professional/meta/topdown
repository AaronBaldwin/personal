Smoking Intro - set motif of cigs, introduce Kevin transition.
Interlude - SARA becomes sentient.
Kevin Intro - Patrolling the city, just fired, looking for a smoke, handling aftermath of the company layoffs.
Google Intro - SARA has escaped from Google.  Bill (William) Fischer and Ted (Theodore) Ardeau are introduced.  They are to spend the whole novel in pursuit of SARA.  Lets maybe consider spreading the novel's three segments into six month blocks.  Regardless, it should be an appropriate amount of time for Kevin to spend at SmokeOut.  It should also make sense as a timeline for the SARA hunt by Bill and Ted.
