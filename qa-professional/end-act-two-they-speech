Delah: And well, you know what they say-

(She speaks slowly but is cut off rather abruptly)

David: And why should I trust them?  What makes them such a fountain of knowledge?

Delah: I'm terribly confused.

David: You are confused because I have a sense of humor.  

Delah: Then speak without it.

David: But my wit is my all, would you strip it from me Delilah?

Delah: Who-

David: Yes, back to the point.  Who are "they", the they as in "you know what -they- say".  "They" have given me unsolicited advice in nearly every walk of life.  Are "they" omniscient experts in every conceivable field?  Is "they" the pronoun which God goes by nowadays?  I never could keep up with that.

Delah: What on earth-?

David: No, quite right, "they" are neither God nor credible in any way.  "They" are a shield behind which people deliver their own anemic opinions.  So tell me what advice you would give.  But do not tell me that "they" advised you on the matter, tell me directly and without doubt.  And if you have doubt, be honest about it.  And if you have a lot of doubt, then hold your tongue.  Save me the trouble of regarding your non-opinion.

Delah: I am speechless!

David: Congenial! (He exits)
