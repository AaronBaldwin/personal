Kevin Larsen was not a smoker.  He had purchased only three or four packages of cigarettes in his years.  He held a personal standard whereby he would not permit himself their pleasure.  This is perhaps an inaccurate description though, for he was not especially partial to cigarettes.  This instinct was the work of his father and a paternal imbuing of dislike for smoking.  Mr. Larsen despised the small mass produced wraps of tobacco.  He was adverse to inhaling or consuming tobacco of any form.  His greatest distaste was for your average Marlboro 20 pack of Class A Cigarettes.

Kevin had only ever purchased these clusters of smokes with the intent of gifting them to a friend.  He felt obligated to do this for friends whom he had taken unprecendented amounts of free cigarettes.  He felt compelled eventually to reimburse them.  The state of California has yet to snuff them out entirely, but it has hiked and inflated the cost up so as to financially ruin addicts of a modest income.

Kevin lifted these nicotine hits at social gatherings and parties.  These events with thronging merrymakers led him to feel vaguely claustrophobic.  He enjoyed parties, but enjoyed escaping from them even more.  Cigarettes permit a socially valid motive to excuse yourself from the ocean of flesh and step outside for a breath of fresh air.  Whenever an attendant of the party produced a carton, Kevin would perk up, approach them, and offer to pay for one of its contents.  The offer was a formality; no nicotine addict, however destitute, would accept payment for one.  They would always provide it free of charge.

He did still, on rare occasion, smoke a cigarello on his own.  Cigarellos are similar to cigarettes, but thicker and more dense.  You typically only inhale the smoke in your mouth rather than down to your lungs.  Kevin would journey to the local 7-11 in times of personal crisis.  There he would purchase a singular cigarello and lighter for the return trip.  It made no sense to purchase a lighter each and every trip.  It made the transaction feel more on a whim.  This pilgrimage to the font of cigarellos happened about every other month.  Under the moons looming wile, he marched.

Today was one exceptionally special occasion.  Kevin rounded the corner of Montgomery street towards the nearest vendor of Black and Milds.  His mind was stagnant with the sudden onset flood of stilted emotions, pressed against each other in a delicate balance.  Their construction was a precarious architecture, each sensation kept in check only by the others.  Kevin needed time to let the foundation set, and the tar of the cigarello would weld it in place.  Until that sturdification, his mind must remain forcedly blank.  To acknowledge any one impetus, any one emotion, could lead to it collapsing upon another.  Thus stood the state of his consciousness: a temporary mold, unexamined, inscrutable, an abyss.

Kevin was a rather recent ex-employee of a company known as Gooroo.  They produced a mobile phone app which, in theory, encouraged people to meditate.  There were lectures every week to help conscious proactive people learn how to meditate.  The app set reminders for people to take time out and meditate.  There were few patrons of the app.  Those who did subscribe were largely large, white women.  They more often than not ignored the daily notification reminding them to meditate.  It was a poorly conceived business, through and through.

These thoughts lingered on the fringes of his conscious mind as he walked briskly towards 7-11.  This particular destination was different from the normal one, this was an especially exceptional occasion.  The sun poked down from its shield of clouds; the glass-paneled buildings mirrored its light along the narrow street.  Kevin shielded his eyes and cursed.
