Kevin disembarked from Muni and walked up the escarpment to the home he rented in the Sunset district.  The row of houses had no gaps between them, each simply beginning where the other ended.  It struck Kevin that it resembled something of a patchwork quilt, the entire street.  His patch's exterior was white, which had decayed into a musky light-yellow and brown color.  The edges of the property line were denoted by two hedges which flared upwards forming the shape of the lower portion of a cone, upside down.  Kevin passed the first one and put his key in the gate which, from a frontal view of the propery, was evenly aligned with the balcony door, the garage door, and Alex's bedroom window.  Wide open, of course, typical of Alex.

Kevin swung open the white gate with its Matryoshka design of hearts radiating both upwards and conversely downwards from its center.  The extremities of the heart patterns terminated with a circular flourish on the left and right sides, symmetrically.  The gate swung open, revealing a lefthand door to the first-floor/garage and a stairwell winding up and intto the left and into the second-floor/house.

Kevin ascended the stairwell, two at a time, gripping the railing.  He rounded the corner and up into the main story.  The hallway opened at the end and to the right to the kitchen and bathroom area.  The left wall was gapped by a large opening leading to the, relatively, cavernous living area and balcony.
"WASP"
*WHACK*
Kevin retreated bckwards and into the wall opposite the living area side entry.  A yellow and black blur whizzed past around the corner.
"God damn it"
"Hi Alex"
"Hey Kevin"

Alex stood halfway between the balcony and the living room, one foot on either side of the threshold.  He faced in the direction the sliding glass door slid open, Kevin's right.  Alex contorted his upper body to be facing the inside of the house.  He wielded a black spray-can in his arm, thumb cupped over the top, pointed downwards at the balcony.  His other arm held the balcony door handle.

The living room was the largest and most open room of the house, making it roughly the size and openness of average rooms in cities with ordinarily sized houses.  A PC tower stood in the corner directly opposite Kevin, above it a desk, and above that a pair of monitors.  Two sensors hung from the living room ceiling, black stalks aimed towards the rectangle's center.  A sofa sat relatively to the right of the desk setup, and to Kevin's direct right as well, and out of Kevin's immediate line of sight.  A television hung on the wall opposite the sofa, Samsung, 55 inches, diagonal.  The wooden floor bore a foamy white blemish.

"Watch your step"
Kevin ducked his way into the living room.  Alex stepped in from the opposite side, sliding the door closed behind him.  He crossed the room and rounded the corner Kevin had just come around, searching for the blur.
*FSSSHHHHT*
"Got 'em!  Killing spree for Alex"
"Just how many of them have you killed today?"
"Just the one, but he put up hella fight"
"Stung you, did he?"
"No, but y'know he was rather evasive"
Kevin seated himself on the sofa and crossed one leg over the other, parallel to the floor.
Alex retreated to the kitchen and emerged with some cleaning solution and paper towels.  He approached the hallway poisonous foam puddle and raised his spray-bottle hand to spray.

"Kevin, there is no way wasp poison and bleach would make a toxic gas is there?"
"I don't think so.  Maybe, but its probably good"
"Can you open the balcony just in case"
"Are there more wasps out there?"
"No"
"You're sure?  I think if it were dangerous it would have to be common knowledge.  Those are pretty common household items"
"Bleach is dangerous, and they didn't always have these bleach-sprays, it used to only come in a jug.  No one was ever fritzing this on Raid before"
"Alright, but you're sure there are no more out there?"
"Well I mean ya there are wasps 'out there', but I don't know of any wasps out there"
Kevin wrinkled his forehead, but stepped to the door and slid it to the right and open.  
"It seems safe.  At least I don't see anything.  Hydrochloride isn't invisible is it?"
"Its colorless, man"
"Then its good we opened the door"
"The wasp wouldn't have gotten in in the first place if you kept it tight"

Alex finished mopping up the hallway wall and stepped into the living room, still clutching a roll of paper towels and bleach spray.
"It was an honest mistake, Kevin.  Its summer time and there are wasps.  I stepped outside for a smoke and it buzzed right in."
"And your window is wide open all day as well, it didn't come through there?
Alex stopped halfway stooped over and eyed Kevin still sitting one leg up on the sofa.
"Seriously?  Are you going to bust my balls about that?  The wasp came from the balcony.  Did you have a shitty day at work today?"
"Well..actually I got laid off today along with 90 percent of the company"
"Oh shit, Gooroo going under is it?  I thought they had funding for at least another year."
"Thats what the CEO had told everyone.  But the shareholders decided it was time to pull out, and that was that."

Alex crinkled his nose up in sudden contemplation.  He stepped up to the sofa and focused on something unseen.
"I should have known, I thought I could smell smoke on you."
"Bullshit, you smell it on yourself".
Alex gripped his shirt between his thumbs and index fingers, lifted his collar to meet his nose halfway, and appraised it.
"I'm not that bad, and you smoke that heavier stuff.  It smells like cranberries or something."
"Its wine flavored, and I'm pretty sure you're just confirmation bias smelling at this point."
"Naw Kevin, you smell like a goddamn cranberry, not that there is anything wrong with that."
Kevin contorted the right side of his face into a half-squint, directed at his roommate.
"But since you got started early anyhow, how about another.  Tell me what happened"
"Alright alright", he betrayed a half-smile half-smirk and roused himself from the sofa.
